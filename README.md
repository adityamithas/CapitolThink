CapitolThink is a web app for users to learn about politicians strictly based on what they've said - no propaganda, no opinion. 

Choose your favorite political figure and read his/her most oft-repeated terminology on the Hill.  But go a step further, and tweet your instant reaction with a creative hashtag.  You can even see how your tags are performing (trending or not, who's influencing them, etc.) using the metrics we provide!

Get informed, and then inform others.  The information presented here is intended to minimize verbiage and maximize impact - the same should be true of your hashtags!  Thanks for using!
